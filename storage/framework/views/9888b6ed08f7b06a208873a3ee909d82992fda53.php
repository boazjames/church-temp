                    God in His infinite mercies heard the cry of the children of Israel and sent Moses His
                    servant to talk to Pharaoh to release His people. The essence of that freedom was so they
                    could go and serve Him or be useful to Him. That has always been the plan of God for His people.
                    He knows that we need freedom from the task master in other to serve Him. God does not set people
                    free so they could live just for themselves but so they could serve Him and in essence, live victoriously.
                    Our mandate as an organization depicts this in word and deed: “To teach, train and equip the body of Christ
                    with the word of faith so that believers can live a victorious life”

                    At Christian Church, we believe in Companionship, the company of believers,
                    a community of interest, common activities, common Christian
                    experiences and the involvement of all towards the growth of all.
                    We believe that there is strength in numbers.It's good to know that
                    when you need someone to pray for you, that you have a network of
                    friends who have your back.God is faithful, through whom we were
                    called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Here,
                    fellowship primarily focuses on our spiritual unity with Christ, an
                    inner relationship.

                    “Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies,
                    kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering” (Colossians 3:12). Care means
                    to be concerned or worried about another person. It means to like to do something
                    for someone or about the situation they are facing. It means to look after or provide
                    for. It means to mind, bother, be interested , to look after, to tend for, to attend
                    to, to nurse or to minister to and watch over. At the core or heart of Christianity
                    is caring for one another. By having a heart that cares, it shows that we are seeking
                    to be like Jesus. As you read through pages in the gospel, you can see the amount of
                    love Jesus showed for everyone.
